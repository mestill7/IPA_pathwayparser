# IPA_pathwayparser
A set of scripts useful for parsing and graphing the results of IPA (Ingenuity Pathway Analysis) exported text files.

This set of scripts provides an easily implemented method for parsing the complete IPA results file, which resembles the following:

### Parsing your IPA results
As a first step, run the IPA parser on your large output file that was exported from IPA.
```
python Parse_IPA.py --help
## Dos filepath
python Parse_IPA.py C:\Users\Molly\ipa\ipa_GroupA_vs_Control_male.txt
## Linux filepath
python Parse_IPA.py /Users/Molly/ipa/ipa_GroupA_vs_Control_male.txt
## Filepaths do not have to be complete, in which case the current directory is used as your output directory.
python Parse_IPA.py ipa_GroupA_vs_Control_male.txt
```
You should then have several output files, as shown below. Note that the default flag "--basic True" can be changed to "--basic False", which would result in additional files being created from the parsed input file.
```
ipa_GroupA_vs_Control_male.txt_canonicalpathways.txt
ipa_GroupA_vs_Control_male.txt_causalnetworks.txt
ipa_GroupA_vs_Control_male.txt_upstreamregulators.txt
```

### Graphing your IPA results
Once the IPA files have been parsed, your can use the content of the provided R script "Automatic_IPA_graphing.R" to plot comparisons between multiple IPA runs. Open your R interface and run the content of the R script interactively. Once all of your input files have been read, you can use the following framework to compare your results:
```
##Designate output directory
out_dir="C:\\Users\\Molly\\Documents\\ipa"
setwd(out_dir)

## Specify your input files
a=list("a.vs.ctl_ko"="C:\\Users\\Molly\\Documents\\ipa\\ipa_treatA.vs.control_knockout.txt",
       "a.vs.ctl_wt"="C:\\Users\\Molly\\Documents\\ipa\\ipa_treatA.vs.control_wildtype.txt",
       "b.vs.ctl_ko"="C:\\Users\\Molly\\Documents\\ipa\\ipa_treatB.vs.control_knockout.txt",
       "b.vs.ctl_wt"="C:\\Users\\Molly\\Documents\\ipa\\ipa_treatB.vs.control_wildtype.txt")
b=lapply(a,function(x) ReadFileForIPAplot(x[1]))

## Specify which IPA results you want to compare
# Example with two datasets
ipa_comparisons_to_make <- c("a.vs.ctl_ko","b.vs.ctl_ko")
gen_plot(ipa_comparisons_to_make,pdf_prefix="Plot_1")
# Example for a four datasets
ipa_comparisons_to_make <- c("a.vs.ctl_ko","a.vs.ctl_wt",
                             "b.vs.ctl_ko","b.vs.ctl_wt")
gen_plot(ipa_comparisons_to_make,k=8,pdf_prefix="Plot_2")
# Example for a single dataset
ipa_comparisons_to_make <- c("a.vs.ctl_ko")
gen_plot(ipa_comparisons_to_make,pdf_prefix="Plot_3")
```

You will now have made some beautiful, if somewhat basic, plots for the following three IPA analysis components: Canonical Pathways, Causal Networks, Upstream Regulators. The current R script is only set up to graph the previously mentioned three analysis components. However, you are welcome to augment the code as needed to accomodate the remaining IPA analysis components (Diseases and Bio Functions, Tox Functions, etc.). Feel free to submit any suggestions/issues for this Github page.
